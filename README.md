# React Chat Application 

I've created a simple chat application that allows users to come together and connect. For them to do this, they first must register an account by clicking on "Register" and filling out the input fields on the registration form. If the user provided proper information in each input field and submitted the form, they should see a green message on top of the registration form, prompting them to close it and login. Otherwise, the user will instead see a red message that informs them to check all input fields in the form. 

Once the user has been prompted with the green message to close the form and login, they should do as instructed. The user at this point can enter in their email and password into the login form. If they enter in an incorrect email or password, they will be immediately notified with a red message. However, if they have entered in correct login credentials, they will be redirected into the chat application, in which they are able to exchange messages with active users.
