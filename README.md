# React Chat Application 

I've created a simple chat application that allows users to come together and connect. For them to do this, they first must register an account by clicking on "Register" and filling out the input fields on the registration form. If the user provided proper information in each input field and submitted the form, they should see a green message on top of the registration form, prompting them to login. Otherwise, the user will instead see a red message that informs them to check all input fields in the form.
